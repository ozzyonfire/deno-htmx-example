# htmx-example

This project is a minimal setup for getting htmx and deno running together. It uses tailwindcss for styling and includes hot-reloading for client-side changes.

## Usage

Start the server by running the following command:

```sh
deno task run
```

- Modify the HTML files in the `public` directory to make changes to the client-side code.
- Any changes made will automatically trigger a hot-reload, allowing you to see the updates in real-time.
